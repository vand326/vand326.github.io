    I created a net art that discusses about voice recognition system. I added what the definition of the voice recognition is, the timeline of the system, and why the voice assistants are females.

   I created a sound visualization that will record the surrounding noises. The sound visualization is screen locked and will follow the user as they scroll down. In this programming,
   I used p5.sound from the p5 library to create the sound visual. The code can be found <a href= "coding/soundvisual.txt"> here.</a>

  I created a mini game which is the snake game. However instead of controlling the snake with keyboard, the user can control the snake with voice command by saying the words, "up, down, left, and right."
  In this coding, I used p5.speech from the p5 library to create the voice command. The code can be found <a href= "coding/snakegame.txt"> here.</a>
