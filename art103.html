    <h3>Nickola Tesla </h3>
    1) He had an obsessive personality
    Playing into his stereotype of a mad scientist, Tesla suffered from many characteristics that today would likely be classified as obsessive-compulsive disorder. He was obsessed with the number three and detested jewelry, round objects, and touching hair.
    <br>
    2) We can credit him for the idea of wireless Internet and smartphones
    Believe it or not, in 1901, Tesla actually had the idea for a wireless way to gather information, code it in his lab, change the frequency, and broadcast it to a hand-held device—nearly exactly how our smartphones work today. Like many of Tesla’s great ideas, it was never created or tested.
    <br>
    3) Mark Twain owes him for shaking his constipation issues
    Tesla was constantly looking for more efficient energy sources and built a high-frequency oscillator, known as an earthquake machine, which shook his Manhattan neighborhood when he conducted experiments. Tesla invited his friend Mark Twain, who was known to have constipation issues, to stand on the machine’s platform while he turned it on; within minutes, Twain was running to the bathroom to relieve his problem.
    <br>
    4) Many of his inventions are still classified
    Tesla died in 1943, but some of his inventions and experiments are still classified by the U.S. government. After his death, all of his possessions were sized by the Office of Alien Property and eventually released to his family, but a few select items are still behind lock and key.
