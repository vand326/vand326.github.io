   This net art represents my first experience with the computer in abstract style.
   I included objects where the audience must click in order to
   go to the next page.

   This website is about one of my favorite childhood shows, Sailor Moon. This is based on the
   English dub version where many scenes were censored to be more appropriate for the US audience.
    I made the theme glitchy to represent the censorship in this show.

    The website is based on Voice Recognition. I created this because this system has helped me in many situations such as voice command GPS while driving and translation with my relatives.
