    <h3>"S@!L0R |\/|00|\|", Net Art, 2018</h3>
    This website is about one of my favorite childhood shows, Sailor Moon. This is based on the
    English dub version where many scenes were censored to be more appropriate for the US audience.
     I made the theme glitchy to represent the censorship in this show.

    <h3>"Detective Saihara", Digital Art, Clip Studio Paint & Photoshop, 2018</h3>
    I drew this character from one of my favorite games, New Danganronpa V3.
    I drew him in a Sherlock Holmes outfit because his role in the game is the detective.

    <h3> "Black Hamburger", Digital Art, Clip Studio Paint & Photoshop, 2018</h3>
    This is my first time drawing food portraits and I wanted to add a unique colors into the foods that
    we don't usually see.
    <p> I was struggling on what kind of food I want to draw so I discussed this idea with my friend named Gaby. She suggested me to draw in unique colors to make the art piece
    look bizarre. She brought up the green eggs and ham from the Dr. Seuss story. When I looked up the images for reference, I noticed how people recreated the green eggs and ham
    into reality so it made me curious if there were other foods that were like this. This research led me to see black hamburger, purple mango, and pink noodles. After seeing this,
    it makes me want to travel to those areas so I can eat those bizarre color food.
