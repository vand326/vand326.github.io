   <h3>"Go with The Flow", Digital Video, 6min.,2018</h3>
   I recorded food color drops inside a clear plastic bowl. My idea is to have the audience feel many
   different emotions, it can be calm or anger. I used adobe premiere to create this video. I used overlay effect
   and had many layers of clips.
