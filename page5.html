   This website is based on one of my favorite childhood shows, Sailor Moon. I've watched the English Dub version
   many times when I was young and would fangirl with my friends about it. I used gifs from giphy.com and put them together.
   On the first page, I created the glitch effect on the Sailor Moon squad image with photoshop.
