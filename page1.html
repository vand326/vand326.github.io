   <h3>"Detective Saihara", Digital Art, Clip Studio Paint & Photoshop, 2018</h3>
   I drew this character from one of my favorite games, New Danganronpa V3.
   I drew him in a Sherlock Holmes outfit because his role in the game is the detective.

   <h3>"S@!L0R |\/|00|\|", Net Art, 2018</h3>
   This website is about one of my favorite childhood shows, Sailor Moon. This is based on the
   English dub version where many scenes were censored to be more appropriate for the US audience.
    I made the theme glitchy to represent the censorship in this show.

    <h3> "Colorful", Processing, 2019</h3>

    <h3> "Gatcha Ruined My Life", p5.js, 2019</h3>
     <p> Fate Grand Order is a mobile game I play almost everyday. These characters are from the game.

       and it is not 100% guaranteed that the player will get the character they want.
