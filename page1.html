   <h3>"Detective Saihara", Digital Art, Clip Studio Paint & Photoshop, 2018</h3>
   I drew this character from one of my favorite games, New Danganronpa V3. I used a
   wacom intuos tablet and drew the sketch and the final result in Clip Studio Paint.
   Later I brought the image to Photoshop to used the hue/saturation tool to enhance the
   colors and the quality of the image.
