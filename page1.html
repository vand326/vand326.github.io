   <h3>"Detective Saihara", Digital Art, Clip Studio Paint & Photoshop, 2018</h3>
   I drew this character from one of my favorite games, New Danganronpa V3.
   I drew him in a Sherlock Holmes outfit because his role in the game is the detective.

   <h3>"S@!L0R |\/|00|\|", Net Art, 2018</h3>
   This website is about one of my favorite childhood shows, Sailor Moon. This is based on the
   English dub version where many scenes were censored to be more appropriate for the US audience.
    I made the theme glitchy to represent the censorship in this show.

    <h3> "Gatcha Ruined My Life", p5.js, 2019</h3>
     <p> Fate Grand Order is a mobile game I play almost everyday. These characters are from the game.
       This game is similar to a lottery where you have to save or spend money to get the character you want
       and it is not 100% guaranteed that the player will get the character they want.

    <h3>"Psycle", RPG Maker and Photoshop, Collaborated with Monica Munoz, 2020</h3>
    Psycle is a 2D pixel art game that centers on the idea of  life during the Covid-19 pandemic. The player, who is a student,  lives  through a loop of daily life activities such as sleep, shower, and homework. When stay at home orders were placed this year, many students were faced with the dilemma of adjusting to only  online classes with no real certainty of how it would develop. Students best interests were and are currently pitted against available resources. Our game, Psycle, metaphorically exhibits the continuous struggle that most students are adhering through this ‘cycle’ of uncertainty, fear, and anxiety.
