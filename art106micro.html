    For this assignment, I used the MJ Beat it Here example coding. There were a few adjustments I made, the 2nd LED light did not work on pin 10 so I placed it in pin 13 and changed the coding. This time
    the 2nd LED was able to lit up.

    The song I used was Gurenge by Lisa, this was an anime opening song from Demon Slayer that I watched. I created the music box based off a box in the Demon Slayer anime. I used bristol board and painted
    the box.
