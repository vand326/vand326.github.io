   <h3> "Love Room", Maya, 2019</h3>

   <div id='page' style='width: 900px'>
  I want to express how love is like. How love can be hypnotizing. There are two human figures
  with different patterns on them. The checker table is to represent how love is a puzzle and a challenge.
  There is a heart in the center to show that it's the main goal. I used Maya to create these 3D models. I used the polyshape and deformed it by changing the vertex position
  and extruding the faces to create the body.
