 "Nostalgic"
I wanted to express my experience with internet on this website by adding old images and animations that I really enjoyed looking at when I was young.  The colors, images, and animations represented how I felt when using the internet. Especially the window screensaver, that resembles how I kept searching through the browsers and wanting to explore more.

Title: S@!L0R |\/|00|\|
When I was young, I loved watching the American version of the Sailor Moon series and would fangirl over the show with my friends. As I grew older, I learned that there was censorship in the American version where many things were changed to make it appropriate for the viewers. Even after knowing, the censorship I still love the American Version since it was the first version I've watched and is my childhood moments. For this assignment, I want to show the audience my love for Sailor Moon series and showing the censorship of how and why.
