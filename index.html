     <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
   <p>
    I enjoy creating works that involve with nostalgic feelings that I want to experience again. Many of the subjects are sceneries, anime, games, and floral. These subjects have impacted my life by giving me many happiness.
   </p>
   <p>
The recent work I created was the “Floral Resin Series.” This work was created with UV Resin, silicone mold, and flowers. When I was creating this, I wanted to keep the flowers in these beautiful states. I know the flowers will wither once it has been pulled out or once the season has changed. When I put this in the resin, I am able to observe the flower in its perfect state without any worries of it withering. I want this to resemble how the moments we have are temporary and that we should cherish it before it is too late. I hope for viewers to enjoy and cherish their moments without any regret.

   <h1>Artist Bio</h1>
   <p>
   Many of Vanna Dao’s works revolve around memories. She recreates the moments she sees with her eyes. She is doing this to bring out the feelings that she had missed so much and that she would want to go back in time to witness those moments again. Dao also hopes that viewers would understand the nostalgic feeling that Dao has and that they will treat their memories as something precious and irreplaceable.
   </p>
   <p>
   One of works being the sunset view she witnessed when she was watching fireworks. She used the sunset view in her art to reminisce the moments and feelings she had. Especially during the COVID- 19 situation, she redrew this view hoping that the situation would die down and that she can see the same sunset again with her family and friends.
