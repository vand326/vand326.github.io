    <h3>"Go with The Flow", Digital Video, 6min.,2018</h3>
    <p>In this video, I was going with abstraction of the food dye color drops in the water. I want the viewers to feel any kind of emotions based on what they see. I did not include music because there is no certain emotion I want the viewers to feel. I used DSLR camera to record the food coloring drop inside a cup of water.</p>

 <h3>"Nostalgic",Net Art, 2018</h3>
I wanted to express my experience with internet on this website by adding old images and animations that I really enjoyed looking at when I was young.  The colors, images, and animations represented how I felt when using the internet. Especially the window screensaver, that resembles how I kept searching through the browsers and wanting to explore more.

<h3>"S@!L0R |\/|00|\|",Net Art, 2018</h3>
When I was young, I loved watching the American version of the Sailor Moon series and would fangirl over the show with my friends. As I grew older, I learned that there was censorship in the American version where many things were changed to make it appropriate for the viewers. Even after knowing, the censorship I still love the American Version since it was the first version I've watched and is my childhood moments. For this assignment, I want to show the audience my love for Sailor Moon series and showing the censorship of how and why.
