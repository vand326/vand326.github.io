   On the first assignment, I was grouped with Vanya and Andrew.
   My idea was to have transportation improved where instead of using cars, we ourselves can transport by flying. My idea was to have leg equipment that can make us fly and we can use materials to prevent pollution and mother nature harm. The way technology is heading is in the process towards the future since we are breaking the limits or border of it. Andrew’s idea was about optical overlays where we can navigate through our eyes without having to use a phone. Andrew believes that technology is heading towards information consumption where us users are obtaining as much information as possible. Vanya’s idea was to be able to regenerate energy fast by having 2 hours of sleep instead of 8 hours of sleep. Vanya believes that technology is going to where it can replace human limbs by 3D printing because not everybody can cooperate well from donors due to reactions or different blood type.
   Our ideas on enhancements within our bodies and the idea of where technology is heading towards were very apart. Our idea of enhancement was from the limbs, eyes, and energy. The idea of where technology is heading towards is breaking limits, information consumption, and biology and technology combined.
