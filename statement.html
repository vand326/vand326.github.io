  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My name is Vanna Dao, I am a student attending San Jose State University majoring
    under Digital Media Art. As an artist, I care about conquering my fears as
    an artist, improving my artwork, and allowing others to see my art. In my
    work, I enjoy creating something that has my personality, interest, and life.
    For this, I have created four projects.: my friend’s birthday adventure,
    Food Color flow projection, childhood memories with the internet.
  </p>
  <p>In my art, the things I’ve included are people and things that are important
  to me and how some things represent me and I want to show that’s who I am. My
  friends are very important to me and sharing how our adventure was or how our
   hangout are is something I’ve always wanted to do like a small vlog. The food
   color flow represents how my life is, how everyday I go with the flow and
   experience all kinds of events and emotions. My childhood always watching
   animation and enjoying seeing colors and it felt like a dream that I wish
   I can go back to. </p>
