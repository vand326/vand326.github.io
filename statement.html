  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>
    As an artist, I create artworks to convey my feelings for the subject matter.
  </p>
  <p>
  Many of the subjects are characters or objects from my favorite videogames and Japanese animation. Creating art allows me to interact with many artists in person and through social media. I love how my art work can bring many different types of people together and allow us to interact together without discrimination. When I look at my artworks, I get flooded with the emotions and moments that occurred during the process of creating my art. I also see myself slowly growing becoming more confident in my art style and as a person. What motivates me to continue creating art is making someoneâ€™s day when they look at my artwork. 
  </p>
  <p>
  My goals are to explore new techniques, form new bonds, create new memories, and inspire many artists to draw what they love.
