  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>
    As an artist, I create artworks to convey my feelings for the subject matter.
  Many of the subjects are characters or objects from my favorite videogames and Japanese animation.
</p>
<p>
The recent work I created was the “Floral Resin Series.” This work was created with UV Resin, silicone mold, and flowers. When I was creating this, I wanted to keep the flowers in these beautiful states. I know the flowers will wither once it has been pulled out or once the season has changed. When I put this in the resin, I am able to observe the flower in its perfect state without any worries of it withering. I want this to resemble how the moments we have are temporary and that we should cherish it before it is too late. I hope for viewers to enjoy and cherish their moments without any regret.
