  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>As an artist, I create artworks based on my favorite games, food, and anime. I use clip studio paint and photoshop for most of my artworks.
  </p>
  <p>When I was young, I sketched many characters from my favorite games and anime such as Pokemon and Sailor Moon. During middle school, I took a break from drawing because I kept getting frustrated with the results of my artwork. I wasnâ€™t able to draw my art the way I imagined and I kept comparing myself to the artists I look up to on social media. In community college, my passion for art came back after taking many art classes. I learned to appreciate my own art style and I want to continue pursuing my art career. </p>
  <p>I want to gain more knowledge and keep improving my artworks and hopefully create a videogame one day.
