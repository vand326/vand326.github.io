  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>
    As an artist, I create artworks to convey my feelings for the subject matter.
  Many of the subjects are characters or objects from my favorite videogames and Japanese animation.
</p>
  Creating art allows me to interact with many artists in person and through social media.
  I love how my art work can bring many different types of people together and allow us to interact
  together without discrimination. When I view my artworks, I see myself slowly growing, becoming more
  confident in my art style and as a person. What motivates me to continue creating artwork is knowing
  that I made someoneâ€™s day when they view my artwork.My goals are to explore new techniques, form new bonds, create new memories, and inspire many artists to draw what they love.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am applying to the BFA program because I want to gain more experience and knowledge in making digital art and gain more experience. With the knowledge I learn, I want to apply it onto my future artworks.
