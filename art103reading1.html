<h3>Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?</h3>
<br>
A system is a whole group that can function through individual factors that depend on each other. An example of this is would be a webpage where we need html and css coding and a server that can run the webpage live. What is not a system is an individual that can function independently without needing other resources from others.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Q2. -- For the 4 system definations you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.</h3>
<br>
Modularity is components of a system can be changed up and still maintain the same. An example of this is legos since we can still build on top even if the shape is different.
Emergence means small different factors that interact with each other to create a very complex system. An example of this is the society since there are different cultures, nationality, gender, and many more.
Decomposability means the element is at its limit of breaking down. An example of this is an atom.
Chaos Theory means unpredictable events occur after a certain action. An example of this is a parallel world where the events will be different if the person does or doesn’t do the action.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Q3 -- Give us your defination of what Tesslation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading.</h3>
<br>
Tessellations is a mosaic pattern of repeating shape patterns that do not overlap or have gapes in between. It was originated from the Sumerians and later passed down to other countries. One tessellation I’ve encountered was this hard-paper material origami folded like a donut and it was able to flip inside out. The hard paper had tessellation designs of red, white, and green triangles. Each time I flip the origami, the design will still remain the same as it did before.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Q4 -- What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?</h3>
<br>
The idea of modularity is the small individual parts can be replaced, modified, or exchanged. The system will still work even without the same shape. However tessellation, the shapes have to remain the same and unchanging and there’s no overlap and no gaps in between.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Q5 -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</h3>
<br>
Complexity is where the design are chaotic but it works together in a way to achieve the goal. It also has a lot of conflict in between before knowing the true goal. Uniform is more organized similar to the chemistry periodic table where the viewers can understand the goal right away.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Q6 -- Group Activity. Each student will need to Bring in a series of 4 diagrams that show evidence of Modularity, Decomposibilty, Emergence and Chaos Theory.</h3>
