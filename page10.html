   <h3>"Colorful Shapes", Processing, 2019</h3>
   I used processing to create consecutive squares and triangles. I also have grid of lines
   making rainbow color effects. There is also a sin wave however it is difficult to see due to it
   blending in with the rainbow grid. The code can be found <a href = "coding/exer1.txt">here.</a>
