    <h3>Chapter 1- First summarize the major elements of this chapter for yourself and write them out in essay form.
Specifically write 1 to 2 paragraphs of description using complete sentences. Go to the Documentation page for more information on how to organize your website with the reading assignment.</h3>

   <h3>1. Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Kline & Clynes definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book?</h3>
   <br>
   The traditional Kline & Clynes definition of the cyborg is an organism having an extended body part that can function on it’s own where it allows the organism to adapt to it’s new environment. One of the first cyborg experiment was the rat with the implanted Rose osmotic pump which causes the biotechnological control loop where the rat can adapt to a foreign environment around them.
   <br>
The one that Clark proposes as the main thesis of his book is creating “man-machine hybrids , artifact- organism systems.” This means where the implanted electronic devices placed inside the body does many functions within such as automatically regulate wakefulness, metabolism, respiration, heart rate , and many other functions that seem like they are from the future.

   <h3>2. From The book, "Cyberneticists were especially interested in self-regulating systems."
What are 2 or more example of these, make sure to include both biological systems and also non-biological systems.</h3>
   <br>
   The electric stove has a system where we can control the heat with the dial. Once we turn on, the electricity goes through the coil and the metal heats up. If the dial is pointing high, then then more electricity is flowing through the coil and making the metal heat up at a higher temperature.
 The respiratory system where we breathe in oxygen through our lungs and breathe out carbon dioxide. Once the oxygen goes into our lungs, the oxygen then goes into our blood cells. This cycle will always repeat where we take in and then we take out.
 <br>
 The mitosis system where our cells divide from each other and multiply. This system goes through 7 phases: interphase, prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophases, and cytokinesis. In this system, our DNA also uncoils and coils automatically to divide itself.

   <br>
   <h3>3. What other kind of definitions of a hybrid humans are there that are not based on definations above but popular in literture, media culture, etc.</h3>
   <br>
   A definition of hybrid humans that is not based on the definitions above is having a human with another animal or plant species to create a new offspring. Many of these are created by humans. Through movies or animation, we can see how there are hybrid humans who can transform from human to an animal and vice versa.

   <h3>Chapter 2 - First summarize the major elements of this chapter for yourself , and write them out in essay form.</h3>
   <br>
 <h3>1. Summarize a definition as described in the book of what the significant attributes  are for 'opaque' technology vs.   'transparent' technology.</h3>
 <br>
 An opaque technology is a system that we are not adapted to yet since it requires attention from us and skills and capacities that do not come to us naturally. A game console is an example since it doesn’t happen naturally, we have to turn it on the console in order to play games and sometimes the screen can go black, the buttons do not respond, or the game cannot be played anymore.
 <br>
 A transparent technology is a system where it is blended in within our lives and it’s very natural occurring to us that we don’t notice it. The trending system is an example since we see things that are trending, we would want to try it too to follow the society. At some point that trend will slowly die down and later a new one will emerge and the cycle will happen again.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3>2. Give some examples of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent and also give some example of a technology that should be more opaque.</h3>
 <br>
 The AI might be better served as more transparent since it would be interesting to have an AI help us naturally and not breaking down. It’s a technology we can depend on and that can benefit us in many ways. Cars also might be better served as more transparent since it’s a vehicle we depend on for transportation and it would be nice to not have the vehicle break down and where it can continue running without having to buy another car.
 <br>
 The social media algorithm should be opaque because it always drags the users into diving through social media continuously when those times could be used for other activities. With this more opaque, we may understand how this algorithm works and stop going through the endless cycle of dark webs. The data consumption should be opaque so the users will know what data is being taken from them and being sold for advertisements.
<br>
<br>
 <h3>3.Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book, seem valid to you? Why?</h3>
<br>
 The discussion about the watch and the dictionary example seem valid to me. I can relate to both of those examples because I’ve been in those positions before. For the watch example, through instinct somehow, I was able to know what time it is and know what to do such as automatically waking up at 7am like I wanted even before the alarm clock happens. Another was knowing the time to make dinner for myself. It has become an instinct or a muscle memory for knowing what actions to do without really looking at the time on my phone.
 <br>
 For the dictionary example, I had a similar experience with it when I’m talking to someone or when I’m writing an essay. Sometimes the word may come out of my mouth or written on the essay even without my knowing and the funny thing is how I’m familiar the word, but I do not remember the definitions. This makes me want to look through a dictionary to see if I used the term correctly. It’s interesting how after using that word, it becomes aware for us and we would research to see what it is or to make sure it’s used correctly.
