   <h3> "Black Hamburger", Digital Art, 2018</h3>

   <div id='page' style='width: 900px'>
   I created a unique color hamburger that can be found in Japan's Burger King.
   In this project, I tried many new things I've never done before. I've never drawn food before and decided to draw with colors
   we don't usually see. I drew the sketch on clip studio paint and painted over on that same sketch layer. Later, I brought it to
   Photoshop to enhance the colors and the quality of the image.
