   <div id='page' style='width: 900px'>
   I created a food series where all the food have a different color. I wanted to bring a twist.
   I wanted to try something new, I've never drawn food before and decided to draw with colors
   we don't usually see. I drew the sketch on clip studio paint and later brought it to Photoshop
   to enhance the colors and the quality of the image.
